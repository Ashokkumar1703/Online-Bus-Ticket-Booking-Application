3.Implement client side and server side validation for form input. 

4.Create Restful API endpoint in spring boot to handle user registration and store user data securely in the database.

Database and Data Modeling:


1. Define entity and set up the necessary data models. 

2. set up a relational database using MySQL/MongoDB and configure JPA entity mapping.

Testing and quality assurance:

Write an unit test case and test application functionality.

Documentation:

1.Create Detailed documentation that explain how to set up, configure and run the project.

 2. Document the API endpoints, request/response formats, and data validation rules.
